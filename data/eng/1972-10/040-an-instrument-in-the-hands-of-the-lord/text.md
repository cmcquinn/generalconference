# “An Instrument in the Hands of the Lord”

I am reminded as I approach you today of a scripture that was written to me in
a letter by one of the missionaries in the North Carolina-Virginia Mission. It
expresses the feelings in my heart and is taken from Alma, the 29th chapter,
verses 9 and 10, where we find:

"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not
glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea,
and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God
to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.

"And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the
Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the
Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I
remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me." ([Alma
29:9-10](/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.9-10?lang=eng#8).)

That we may all remember that arm is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
