# A 12-Year-Old Deacon

My beloved brethren of the priesthood, as I begin, I would like to direct my
remarks to each 12-year-old deacon attending this general priesthood session.
Wherever you are, I want to acknowledge your presence and to tell or remind
you of the experience that President Gordon B. Hinckley had when he was, like
you are, a 12-year-old deacon.

From his biography we read: "Not long after he was ordained a deacon, he
attended his first stake priesthood meeting with his father. ... He felt a
little out of place as he found a seat on the back row of the Tenth Ward
chapel while [his father] (who was serving in the stake presidency) took his
place on the stand. To open the meeting, the three or four hundred men present
stood and sang William W. Phelps's triumphant anthem ... : 'Praise to the man
who communed with Jehovah! / Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer. / Blessed
to open the last dispensation, / Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.' "

Reflecting back on that experience, President Hinckley said: "Something
happened within me as I heard those men of faith sing. It touched my heart. It
gave me a feeling that was difficult to describe. I felt a great moving power,
both emotional and spiritual. I had never had it previously in terms of any
Church experience. There came into my heart a conviction that the man of whom
they sang was really a prophet of God. I knew then, by the power of the Holy
Ghost, that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God." [1]

Even as that experience had by President Hinckley as a 12-year-old deacon was
"one he would remember for the rest of his life," [2]  I pray that the
experience you are having will be one you will remember for the rest of your
lives.

Now, I invite us all to look at this remarkable cast bronze sculpture entitled
_Deacons' Bench._ For those of you who cannot see it, _Deacons' Bench_ is the
likeness of five deacons, caught in a candid moment while seated on a bench in
church.

As you look at these five deacons, what do you see? Now, as I read statements
by two former Presidents of the Church, I will ask the question a little
differently: what _can_ you see?

President Joseph Fielding Smith declared: "Our young people ... are the nobility
of heaven, a choice and chosen generation who have a divine destiny. Their
spirits have been reserved to come forth in this day when the gospel is on the
earth, and when the Lord needs valiant servants to carry on his great latter-
day work." [3]

President Spencer W. Kimball declared, "We are rearing a royal generation ...
who have special things to do." [4]

In light of these prophetic declarations, if we expand our vision beyond five
deacons on a bench to include all of the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood,
then what can you see?

I trust and pray that we can all see their divine potential; that we can see
them going forth as bearers of the holy priesthood and as missionaries
preaching "the everlasting gospel" [5]  by the Spirit [6]  "to the nations of
the earth"; [7]  that we can see them as faithful husbands and fathers and as
valiant servants in and leaders of the Church and kingdom of God in these
latter days.

In order for us to more clearly envision the divine destiny of this chosen and
royal generation, we need only to reflect upon the 12-year-old Jesus, who went
up to Jerusalem with His parents to celebrate the Feast of the Passover. [8]

Who was this 12-year-old boy? What was His mission and destiny? And how was He
able to fulfill it?

We proclaim and the scriptures confirm that He was and is Jesus Christ, the
Son of the living God; [9]  that He "came into the world ... to be crucified for
the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and
to cleanse it from all unrighteousness" [10]  "that salvation might come unto
the children of men even through faith on his name"; [11]  that as a youth He
"increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man"; [12]  that
He "grew up with his brethren, and waxed strong, and waited upon the Lord for
the time of his ministry to come"; [13]  and that He "was in all points
tempted like as we are." [14]  Indeed, He faced "temptations of every kind"
[15]  but "gave no heed unto them." [16]  And when confronted by Lucifer, "the
father of all lies," [17]  "the author of all sin," [18]  Jesus was protected
not only by His knowledge of the scriptures but also by His absolute obedience
to the word and will of His Father, [19]  and He commanded, saying, "Get thee
hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve." [20]

Now, as to how He was able to fulfill His mission and destiny, consider these
words of Jesus, who said:

"When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and
that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these
things.

"And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do
always those things that please him." [21]

That each one of us, as sons of God, [22]  can fulfill our mission and destiny
is made plain by these words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "Verily,
thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his
sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and
keepeth my commandments ... may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time
receive of his fulness." [23]

I so testify, as I also bear my witness that President Thomas S. Monson is
indeed a prophet of God and that he and his counselors in the First Presidency
and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators, in
the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
