# The Sustaining of Church Officers

There have been no changes among the General Authorities since the last
general conference. It is therefore proposed that we sustain all of the
General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present
constituted.

Those in favor may manifest it by the uplifted hand. Any opposed may manifest
it by the uplifted hand.
