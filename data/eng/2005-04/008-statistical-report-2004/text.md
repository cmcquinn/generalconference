## First Presidency Expresses Sympathy

At the beginning of the Saturday afternoon session, President Gordon B.

"We join those throughout the world who mourn the passing of Pope John Paul
II, an extraordinary man of faith, vision, and intellect, whose courageous
actions have touched the world in ways that will be felt for generations to
come.

"The Pope's voice remained firm in defense of freedom, family, and
Christianity. On matters of principle and morality he was uncompromising. On
his compassion for the world's poor, he has been unwavering."
